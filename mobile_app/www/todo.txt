allow user to create combos


use a boxing bell icon to replace the "start boxing" button

implement pausing round/workout

add to github - implement travisci
allow user to either use the numbers or the combination name (will need a time between combo name for interval when using names)
    can use the number of punches * time between punches

add ability to let user learn the combos. like have app say name of combo, then step thru punches saying each punch

add major combos like war, basic, espresso, rumble
    make this a seperate feature. something where they learn the combination. make it a seperate button on main page that navigates to another page. exclude it from the actual boxing. use only regular combos for boxing

allow users to create a workout plan, add stuff like abs, toe/ball things, jump rope, 21 drill, etc.  the stuff we do in class

styling

need tests

add eslint

this stuff for treeshaking
    rollup.js
    closure compiler
